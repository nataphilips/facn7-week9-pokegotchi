## user journey

We've always wanted to go back to 90s and get a tamagotchi. Well, with this one you can have a pokemon as a tamagotchi!

* Pick a pokemon to play. It searches within a huge API to find the one you want
* If you don't know any pokemons, there is a drop-down with a few cute ones
* Click "Play" to play with a pokemon
* He's gonna get hungry eventually and won't play with you until you feed him
* He will poop himself after playing too much, your duty is to clean up
* You can follow the pokemon's stats on the screen
* Your pokemon will tell you what's up
* If you accidently refreshed your page, don't worry! Your pokemon and his stats are saved in a local storage
* If you got tired of your pokemon, pick a new one and start over!
